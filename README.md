My dotfiles have evolved over the past year or so. They now also contain a bunch of configuration files that aren't necessarily dotfiles (for example, my PhpStorm settings/keymap files).

The [dotfiles of @holman](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles) have been a massive inspiration for the way my files are laid out, I'm a huge fan of the way the files are organised by topic rather than by purpose. You can find all my git stuff in one directory and everything related to tmux in another, instead of putting all aliases in one folder and all configuration files in another.

At this point, all my files lack is proper documentation for them to be useful to others, but feel free to take or reuse whatever you can find in this repository. Should you make a great improvement in these files, I'd really appreciate if you contribute your changes back!
